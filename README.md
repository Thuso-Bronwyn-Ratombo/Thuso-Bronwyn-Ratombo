- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Thuso-Bronwyn-Ratombo
  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in anything that seems complex. So far I'm obsessed with chess, solving rubik's cubes, doing short Mathematics or Science related courses and diving as deep as I can in programming.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data structures and algorithms and how to solve different rubik's cubes.
